description: Create a plan for a multi-step task, before touching code
---

Use the `tickets` skill, and use `tk-current` to get the path of the current ticket file. Read the 
file to get the current details of the ticket.

Then use the planner agent to convert the design into a very detailed plan.

Write the plan to the Design section of the current ticket file.
